# odin-landing-page

The goal of this project was to use HTML and CSS to replicate a webpage given in the following
reference image: https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/81a5d553f4073e593d23a6ab00d50eef8620796d/foundations/html_css/project/imgs/01.png.

Specifications for fonts, font sizes, and colors were given in another reference image,
shown here: https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/a38403e7d81cc8305af16ac48985cfbde87834d6/foundations/html_css/flexbox/project-landing-page/imgs/02.png.

However, instead of attempting to replicate the page exactly as shown in the first reference image,
I added some of my own personal touches, giving the page an "A Song of Ice and Fire" theme, which is a book
series I enjoy. 

The book cover images used are the official book covers for the series. The logo in the header can be found at: https://pixabay.com/vectors/brand-internet-logo-brand-logo-7833518/, and the dragon image was created by Pixabay user MythologyArt and can be found at: https://pixabay.com/illustrations/dragon-warrior-battle-fight-9159542/.

This project was an exercise of my basic HTML and CSS skills. For the CSS portion, I primarily used Flexbox to arrange the content on the screen.
